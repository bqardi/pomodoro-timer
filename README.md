# Pomodoro timer

A simple Pomodoro timer to track your work time and breaks.

The default settings are:

- 25 minutes for working.
- 5 minutes for break.
- Long break 30 minutes.
- Long break after every 4 pomodoros.

If you have a Philips HUE lamp, you can attach it and it will light green when it's time for a break, blue for a long break and red when it's time to go to work.
